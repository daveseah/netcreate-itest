          <dt>Node</dt>
          <dd>
            The thing or <em>entity</em> (shown as circles) that is connected through
            relationships. This could be individual people, groups of people,
            institutions (like churches, organizations, schools). One way of thinking
            about this is that nodes are nouns and edges are verbs - nodes are things
            that are connected through edges.{' '}
            <em>
              <strong>Similar terms include:</strong> actor, vertex
            </em>
          </dd>
          <ul>
            <dl>
              <dt>Ego</dt>
              <dd>
                This refers to the node you are focused on at the moment and the
                connections that they have.{' '}
              </dd>
            </dl>
          </ul>

          <dt>Edge</dt>
          <dd>
            The relationships between nodes you are considering (shown as lines).
            Relationships can take on many forms: nodes could be connected through
            somewhat intangible relationships, such as friendship or not liking one
            another. Edges can be based on interactions, such as talking to one
            another or being in conflict. They could also be defined by sharing
            resources, such as money or information.{' '}
            <em>
              <strong>Similar terms include:</strong> line, tie, arc
            </em>
          </dd>

          <ul>
            <dl>
              <dt>Edge weight</dt>
              <dd>
                Edges can have a value attached to them. So, for instance, an node
                could sent $10,000 to another actor. Or, they could share three
                interactions of the same type with one another. This value is referred
                to as a weight.{' '}
                <em>
                  <strong>Similar terms include:</strong> value
                </em>
              </dd>

              <dt>Directed or undirected edges</dt>
              <dd>
                Edges can either be directed or undirected. If a relationship is
                directed, it is being sent from (originating from) one node to another
                node. Node A may say they are friends with Node B, but Node B does not
                say Node A does this. Or Node A gives Node B something, such as
                resources, information, or an illness. However, in some cases, edges
                are defined as undirected. Two people who share a meal together or are
                married are both engaged share an undirected edge.{' '}
                <em>
                  Note: in some academic literatures, the term "edge" is reserved for
                  an undirected relationship, while the term "arc" is used to refer to
                  directed ties.

            </dl>
          </ul>

          <dt>Attributes</dt>
          <dd>
            Characteristics of the nodes or edges. A node could be designated by
            gender, for instance or the amount of wealth they possess. They could also
            be characteristics you find from the network itself - such as how many
            ties an node has (degree centrality).{' '}
          </dd>

          <dt>Centrality</dt>
          <dd>
            This is a way of ranking the importance of individuals within a network.
            There are many different ways to measure importance, such as degree
            centrality, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality.{' '}
          </dd>
          <ul>
            {' '}
            <dl>
              <dt>Degree Centrality</dt>
              <dd>
                Degree centrality is a measure of how many connections a node has. An
                node with many ties that are being sent to them has a high in-degree
                centrality. In a friendship network, this can be easily recognized as
                popularity. Nodes sending many outgoing ties (high out-degree
                centrality) may be thought of as expansive in their relationship.
              </dd>

              <dt>Betweenness Centrality</dt>
              <dd>
                Nodes with high betweenness centrality serve as connectors between
                other individuals who wouldn't otherwise be directly connected. They
                may not be connected to a large number of people (that would be high
                degree centrality), but they are unique in their connections. If an
                actor with high betweenness centrality was removed from a network, the
                network would be more fragmented and less connected. Often researchers
                are interested in finding actors with high betweenness centrality
                because they can control whatever flows in the networks. For instance,
                military analysts often look for nodes with high betweenness in a
                terrorist network.
              </dd>

              <dt>Eigenvector Centrality</dt>
              <dd>
                Eigenvector centrality ranks actors based on their connection to other
                highly central nodes. So, a nodes importance as measured by
                eigenvector centrality are dependent on the other nodes with whom they
                share connections. Google's PageRank algorithm was a famous
                application of a version of this type of centrality, and allowed them
                to return highly relevant results in search for users.
              </dd>
            </dl>
          </ul>

          <dt>Communities</dt>
          <dd>
            A community in a network is a way of thinking about grouping, often by
            finding densely connected sets of nodes. A community within a network that
            is tightly connected to one another but not to an outside group might be
            seen as a faction, such as rival political groups. In this case, nodes
            with high betweenness centrality in a network with multiple factions might
            be some of the only points of contact between rival groups - a potentially
            powerful but also difficult position to be in.
